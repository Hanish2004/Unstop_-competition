# Project Name

## Description

This project contains the code for a web application designed to cater to different user groups: doctors, elders, and guardians. The application is primarily focused on providing a seamless user experience for each category. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Open `choice-home page.html` in your web browser. This will serve as the entry point of the application.

2. Upon running `choice-home page.html`, you will be redirected to the respective pages based on your role (doctor, elder, or guardian). Please note that the login and register pages currently lack links to navigate to other pages due to insufficient data.

3. If the login and sign in functionalities are successfully implemented, users will be directed to the following pages:
   - Chatbot
   - Message
   - Homepage
   - Index (Monitoring Page)
   - Contact Page

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and a compatible web browser before running the application.
- In case of any issues or questions, feel free to [contact us](mailto:hanish232004@gmail.com).
